# This file was originally going to be used to import several packages used within the main program, to reduce clutter.
# Little would I quickly learn this was a hassle.
# Memory would be greatly reduced as resources were wasted calling every package, all at once, all the time.
# It would be a complex process trying to call needed functions. Not difficult, just annoying.
# The short sighted ease of access was actually a hidden threat I didn't take seriously until now.
# I mistakenly thought that it wouldn't hurt, it was only a few packages!
# Let's not do that again!

# The fate of this file is yet to be determined...
